# CSVExport
Export and manipulate a CSV file with specific intent
This program was designed and written for a specific purpose in mind.
Most will not find this program useful aside from learning. The basic
implementation is the following:
Open a file to write called output.csv.
Collect some data from the user.
Process a file called import.csv located in the same directory as the
program.
Save the altered information to the output.csv file and close it.

Included in the root is a template file used to generate the
output.csv based on specific user-required parameters. The
template file also houses a primitive to-do list.
